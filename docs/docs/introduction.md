✔︎ Leveraging the native `<dialog>` element if desired  
✔︎ Closing dialog on overlay click and <kbd>ESC</kbd>  
✔︎ Toggling `aria-*` attributes  
✔︎ Trapping and restoring focus  
✔︎ Firing events  
✔︎ DOM and JS APIs  
✔︎ Fast and tiny

> Originally, this repository was a fork from [accessible-modal-dialog ↗](https://github.com/gdkraus/accessible-modal-dialog) by Greg Kraus. It has gone through various stages since the initial implementation and both packages are no longer similar in the way they work.
